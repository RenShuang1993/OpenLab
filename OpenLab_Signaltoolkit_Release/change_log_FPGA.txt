==== OpenLab Oscilloscope FPGA DE0 Changelog ====

V1.3.1

Changelog:

.) fixed a critical bug in the single shot routine -> single shot was NOT working before this version!
.) fixed a critical bug in the header and payload CRC calculation -> CRC errors should be drastically reduced now (now only com. related CRC errors)
.) fixed misleading signal routing of ADC data to sampling units
.) removed unnecessary START state because the initial byte transfer is not required anymore
.) removed the variable baudrate configuration --> baudrate is now fixed at 1.2Mbaud (works reliable on all tested machines)
.) added a "Debug" mode which is used to show useful status information via the on-board LEDs (only accessible via a certain switch setting)
.) rewritten whole triggering module to distinguish between auto, normal and single shot triggering modes (those are now separately processed at the GUI as well)

V1.2.9

Changelog:

.) updated timings of the PC-wait state --> no more magic numbers and strange count values
.) wait time in PC-wait state slightly reduced --> faster data transfer (seems to be stable with new GUI version from 20.02.17 + communication fix)

V1.2.5 (only internal release)

Changelog:

.) fixed a bug where the trigger position was off due to way to strict debouncing of the trigger signal
.) fixed timing issues where signals in ETS looked strange
.) completely rewritten NACK message generation and error detection -> did not work in previous versions!
.) increased edge detect frequency counter to support full 4 bytes count values
.) removed many unnecessary shared variables in the protocol state machine -> important!
.) removed unnecessary NACK wait state
.) plausibility check in SSM command if 0 was send as samples per packet --> send NACK message to GUI with correct Error Code
.) FPGA will turn off data transfer (set channel 1 and 2 to off) if a GHWV or GSWV was received --> prevent data overflow/overwrite if a resync with GUI is necessary
.) improved ETS ADC first sample timing to ensure trigger position is not delayed --> added own timing for each ETS stage
