Changes from OpenLab Scope V4.0.5 to V4.0.6

R34 and R104 from 27 --> 180 Ohm necessary to compensate high tolerances of the MMBFJ112 JFETs during volume-production --> DO NOT LOWER VALUE! (CRITICAL)
R35 and R105 from 1k --> 560 Ohm necessary to compensate high tolerances of the MMBFJ112 JFETs during volume-production --> DO NOT INCREASE VALUE! (CRITICAL)
fixed bad GND and COMP header placement
fixed readability of silk screen at some references
fixed SMD paste on Test_Pad.kicad_mod
added more GND vias at big copper GND areas (for example BNC connectors; DE0 header)

Changes from OpenLab Scope V4.0.4(before R64 and R134 changes) to V4.0.5

R64 and R134 from 220 --> 330 Ohm better ADC range without distortion in GUI pos side
R34 and R104 from 68  --> 27 Ohm  better Zero-Line adjustment 
R35 and R105 from 820 --> 1k Ohm  better Zero-Line adjustment
