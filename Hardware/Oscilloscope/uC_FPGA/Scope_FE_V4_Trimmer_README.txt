---TRY TO APPLY NO GLUE AT ALL--- 

Consider to apply no glue at all due to time-consuming and not fully safe Loctite application.
(this will be problematic for high volume production)
Tests showed that too much glue will change the set zero-line and break calibration.
It is suggested to try to use the Oscilloscope V4 PCBs without glue at all. (like V2 and V3 PCBs before)
Please ensure that not much force is applied doing calibration. And that the trimmer is only set if really necessary!
(To prevent wear-out of the mechanical parts)


PROCEDURE TO APPLY GLUE TO 100 OHMS TRIMMER (fixing R33&R103 drifting during transport) --> !!EXPERIMENTAL!!

Pot. Trimmer fix value with glue Loctite 2701

WARNING: DO NOT USE SUPER GLUE OR HOT GLUE! -> "strong" glues will destroy trimmer!

1. set pot. trimmer to desired value (zero line ~0V) (tolerances of +- 39mV are OK) --> apply ZERO force!
2. MAX 1 drop (ON THE LEFT away from the BNC) of glue on the side of the trimmer (to ensure glue is between moving parts and NOT only on top)
3. recheck value setting after ~1H --> cleanup glue with paper towel! THIS IS IMPORTANT! High amount of glue on other components will change resistance!
--> cleanup around the trimmer!
--> check value and correct if necessary! If glue is dry trimmer will not move!
4. let it dry another 1H --> recheck again!
5. during check let the board run for at least 5 minutes to ensure that the shown value is not changing anymore and settled
(to prevent trying to fix "wrong" values which are only a side effect of the board getting started up OR because wet glue residues change the resistance)
6. glue will fully dry after >= 8H
