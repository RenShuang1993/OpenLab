-------------------Requirements-------------------

HOST:

1. Quartus Suite installed
2. Quartus SignalTap II up and running connected to 
   JTAG of the DEO Device. This is done over a
   Telnet connection to the JTAG interface
   which furthermore tunneling a UART connection

DEVICE:

1. Virtual JTAG megafunction IP-Core by Altera
2. JTAG to UART module by Binary Logic Copyright (C) 2014
   This module acts as an 8-bit parallel FIFO interface
   connected to the Altera Virtual JTAG module.
   It links to two FIFO's which are generated by the megafunction wizard
   This design follows the design pattern recommended in Altera's 
   Virtual JTAG Magafunction user guide.
3. FIFO Buffer as described in 2.
4. Altera PLL megafunction feeding point 5 with a higher frequency (for example 100Mhz)
5. Something that uses the new connection (for example a FSM, acting as loopback adapter)

-------------------Speed-testing------------------

For speed testing the communication, a batch file was written which performs a test procedure.
First the current system time of the host is saved in a variable.
Then the batch file starts a external telnet program which is able to use a script file.
(the used telnet program is freeware and available at: http://support.moonpoint.com/downloads/windows/network/Telnet/tst10.php)
This program waits for the character "S" which is transfered by the DE0 eval board.
After reciving the character the telnet application sends the character "a" as acknowledge.
Then the DE0 board sends exactly 4095 bytes on data + the character "C".
The telnet program then closes automatically.
The batch file then compares the actual system time with the start time.

During the tests a maximum data rate of 110 bytes per second was measured.

-------------------Pros and Cons-------------------

Pro: Only one cable is necessary for powering the board, programming the board and communication

Con: The whole Altera Quartus Suite has to be installed just for communication
     The Quartus SignalTap II server has to run in the background
     No cross-platform support (stuck at Altera devices)
     EXTREM low data rates (110 bytes per second!)
     High overhead (JTAG to UART --> UART to telnet)
