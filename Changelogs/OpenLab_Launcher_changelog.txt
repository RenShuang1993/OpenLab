OpenLab Launcher Version 260218 - ready for release

merged last version of the Launcher app from Mrs. Schierer (comply to our naming scheme and structure)
CRITICAL bugfix - unable to launch any app due to launcher configuration overwrite with feedback config data (introduce feedback flag)
--> this lead to invalid entries in the launcher path definitions (null as foldername,...)
--> split configuration into two separate files one for defining paths, folders and arguments for the apps and one specific file for
saving Toolkit relevant information (for example introduce feedback flag)
update - moved log files into log folder

WARNING: All Buttons enabled in this version! To disable a button change behavior in LauncherGUI.fxml
