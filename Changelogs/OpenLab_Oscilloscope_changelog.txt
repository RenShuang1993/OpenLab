GUI Version 1.1.4 --> READY FOR RELEASE
Changes:
removed check if single shot packet is in range, because this routine was buggy
check is not necessary in GUI because FPGA only sends packet if trigger event was detected

Changes:
this is a merge from the last version from Mrs. Schierer to comply with our naming scheme and structure
updated JNA lib from 4.5.0 to 4.5.1
updated purejavacom lib from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1

Known Bugs: 
NONE

GUI Version 1.1.2 --> not for release! internal version by Susanne Schierer
Changes:
bugfix - critical bug in additional measurements which previously lead to a memory leak
removed old unused code in all files
added some feedback questions about add. measurements and FFT

Known Bugs: 
NONE

GUI Version 1.1.1 --> not for release!
Changes:
switched order what should happen first if feedback dialog on exit should be shown
---> now disconnects device only if feedback dialog is closed AND exit condition is
fulfilled again. (for example X on top right)
---> before this change, device was disconnected immediately and then feedback dialog
was shown. So if user wanted to continue measurement user had to reconnect again
