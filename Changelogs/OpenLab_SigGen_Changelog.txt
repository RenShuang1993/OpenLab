OpenLab SigGen Version 20180403_113 - Release

bugfix - if the external HW was selected the GUI used always the first sound device found
--> this is generally bad for linux --> changed so the user is able to select the sound device
in the options menu. The selected device is also saved in a config file.
bugfix - volume control in linux is not linear! Previous version calculated wrong values for
sound device.
